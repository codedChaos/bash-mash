# This script is used to check and update your GoDaddy DNS server to the IP address of your current internet connection.
#
# Original PowerShell script by mfox: https://github.com/markafox/GoDaddy_Powershell_DDNS
# Ported to bash by sanctus
# Added AAAA record by Binny Chan
#
# Improved to take command line arguments and output information for log files by pollito
#
# First go to GoDaddy developer site to create a developer account and get your key and secret
#
# https://developer.godaddy.com/getstarted
#
# Be aware that there are 2 types of key and secret - one for the test server and one for the production server
# Get a key and secret for the production server

# Check an A record and a domain are both specified on the command line.
