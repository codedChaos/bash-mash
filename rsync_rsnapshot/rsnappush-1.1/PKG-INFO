Description: rsnappush(1) - rsync-based pushed incremental snapshot
        ============================
        
        ## SYNOPSIS
        
        **rsnappush** [**-h**] [**-r RSYNC_OPT**] [**-q**] *SOURCE_PATH* [*ACCOUNT:*]*DEST_PATH*
        
        ## DESCRIPTION
        
        **rsnappush** is a wrapper around rsync(1) to assist in file-level
        incremental snapshots that are pushed to a destination.
        Unchanged files are hard-linked.  Files are plainly laid
        out in a directory for each snapshot: *DEST_PATH*/*backup-YYYYmmdd-HHMM*/
        for easy access and restoration.
        
        *SOURCE_PATH* is any local path.
        
        *DEST_PATH* is a path, local or remote.  If remote, *ACCOUNT* specifies
        an ssh(1)-compatible account description, such as *USER*@*HOST*.
        
        Additionally, under *DEST_PATH* there is a *permissions*/ directory
        created that has compressed output from getfacl(1).  setfacl(1) can be used
        to restore permissions from this file once it is uncompressed.
        
        ## EXAMPLE
        
            rsnappush --rsync-opt=--partial-dir=/home/user2/rsync-partial \
                      /home/user user2@remotehost:backups/
        
        
        ## OPTIONS
        
        **-h**, **--help**
        : display a help message
        
        **-r**, **--rsync-opt=RSYNC_OPT**
        : pass-thru options to rsync(1). Use the '=' syntax to pass through options,
        and include prefixing dashes.  See [EXAMPLE][] for details.
        
        **-q**, **--quiet**
        : emit less output
